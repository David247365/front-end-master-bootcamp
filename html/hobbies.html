    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Producing Music</h2>
    <p>I love producing music. I mainly produce EDM becasue it allows me to be creative and tell a story through music.</p>
    <p>It makes me feel calm because all of my energy and focus is put into producing.</p>
    <p>I have not travelled because of my hobby(yet), but I've had some pretty amazing experiences. I've won a few remix competitions and my remixes are on spotify, youtube, and many music platforms.</p>
    <p>This is a video on my remix of Simulation by CRWTH:</p>
