    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Some things about me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is David Soto and I live in San Antonio, TX. I'm originally from Chicago but lived here most of my life. I am currently in between jobs but I will be working as a customer service representative at eBay. I hope to grow my career within eBay and apply for any web development/software engineering positions.</p>
    <p>I am looking to be a front-end web developer but I would like to grow my skills to become a full-stack developer someday. I'm not sure what my ultimate goal is yet, but I do know I want to make web development my career. I'll just work out any details as they come along.</p>

        <li>I love listening to and producing music.</li>
        <li>I'm always interested in learning new things.</li>
        <li>I enjoy being creative when it comes to anything like music, art, or web development.</li>
    </ul>
